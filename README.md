# JACKSON HOLE CENTER FOR THE ARTS - 2023

This is a repo for a digital display of two creative code pieces to be shown through the summer of 2023.

The JHCenter uses a display platform called [OptiSigns](https://www.optisigns.com)

And since these are pieces written in [p5.js](https://www.p5js.org), I am referencing documentation on OptiSigns website about displaying websites with their [Websites](https://www.optisigns.com/apps-list/website) application.

Somewhat concerned with the display properties translating from p5 to OptiSigns application for proper resolution, dimensions, and how it might affect connected "circles" in the aquarius sketch.

There are two digital pieces being displayed:

AQUARIUS - live version online here - [AQUARIUS](https://jkentwhite.com/jhcenter/aquarius)
